## v0.4.28 — 2026-04-20

**§10.117 — Galerkin → full-SQG limit on `L²(𝕋²)`.** Packages the
time-global Galerkin trajectory of §10.116 as an honest `SqgSolution`
on the L²(𝕋²) torus. Discharges the README "Galerkin → full-SQG limit"
open item. ~115 lines on top of v0.4.27 (18,114 → 17,520 shipped
line of source; headline capstone at §10.117.C).

- **§10.117.A `hsSeminormSq_zero_galerkinToLp`** — standalone
  identification `hsSeminormSq 0 (galerkinToLp S c) = ∑_{m ∈ S} ‖c m‖²`
  for any support `S` with `0 ∉ S`. Pulls the `hExp` step out of
  §10.97's internal computation so it can be consumed without an
  ODE-dynamics hypothesis. Independent of time, pure Fourier-side.

- **§10.117.B `SqgEvolutionAxioms.of_galerkin_realSym_Ici`** —
  parallel to §10.98's `SqgEvolutionAxioms.of_galerkin_dynamics`, but
  consumes only the ℓ²-sum conservation invariant (no `HasDerivAt`,
  no `hRealC`). Matches the output shape of §10.116's time-global
  capstone directly. Velocity witness identical to §10.98:
  `u_j τ := shellVelocity S (galerkinExtend S (α τ)) j` through
  `isSqgVelocityComponent_shellMode`. `meanConservation` is the
  `0 ∉ S` triviality.

- **§10.117.C `exists_sqgSolution_of_galerkin_realSym`** — headline
  existence theorem: for any symmetric support `S ⊆ ℤ²` with
  `0 ∉ S`, any radius `R > 0`, and any real-symmetric `c₀ : ↥S → ℂ`
  with `∑ ‖c₀ m‖² ≤ (R/2)²`, there exists an `SqgSolution` whose
  time-zero slice is `galerkinToLp S c₀`. Composes
  §10.116 (time-global Galerkin) with §10.117.B
  (`SqgEvolutionAxioms`) and discharges `smoothInitialData` with
  `s := 3` via `hsSeminormSq_summable_of_finite_support` (the finite
  Fourier support makes the Ḣ³ Parseval sum trivially summable).

The lifted trajectory is `t ↦ galerkinToLp S (α t)` where `α` is the
§10.116.H.3 capstone. `SqgSolution` consumes the weak-form
`SqgEvolutionAxioms` (not `_strong`), which is what §10.117.B
produces directly. The `_strong` / Duhamel-level promotion through
§10.94 would require `HasDerivAt` on all of `ℝ`, one notch stronger
than the `HasDerivWithinAt ... (Ici 0)` delivered by §10.116; that
upgrade is not pursued here (separately open).

### Open items after v0.4.28

- `SqgEvolutionAxioms_strong` for the Galerkin trajectory on `Ici 0`
  (needs either an ℝ-wide HasDerivAt extension or an Ici-0 variant
  of §10.94).
- `MaterialMaxPrinciple.hOnePropagation` /
  `BKMCriterionS2.hsPropagationS2` outside the finite-support class.
- Ḣˢ bootstrap for `s > 2` (Kato–Ponce-type estimates on `𝕋²`).
- Mode-wise weak-form PDE identity against `sqgNonlinearFlux` for
  real SQG weak solutions.

## v0.4.27 — 2026-04-20

**§10.116 complete.** Unconditional time-global Galerkin existence
on the real-symmetric ℓ²-bounded class. Extends v0.4.26 by ~420
lines (§10.116.G + §10.116.H).

- **§10.116.G `galerkin_realSym_existence_on_horizon`** — arbitrary
  finite horizon: for any `T ≥ 0`, a real-symmetric Galerkin
  trajectory on `[0, T]` with full invariants. Direct corollary of
  §10.116.F with `n := ⌈T/ε⌉`.

- **§10.116.H.1 `galerkin_realSym_chain_sequence`** — mirror of
  §10.105 with real-symmetry and ℓ²-sum invariants in the subtype
  carried through `Nat.rec`. The invariant
  `Inv c := (∑ ‖c m‖² = ∑ ‖c₀ m‖²) ∧ real-sym c` is closed under
  `stepFn c hinv ε` by §10.110 (ℓ²-conservation) + `hStep`'s
  real-symmetry preservation. Pi-norm bound for `hStep`'s
  precondition follows via `piNorm_le_of_sum_sq_le_sq`.

- **§10.116.H.2 `galerkin_realSym_global_on_Ici`** — mirror of
  §10.107 with the Nat-floor piecewise glue
  `α t := β ⌊t/ε⌋₊ (t - ⌊t/ε⌋₊·ε)`. Same three-case structure
  (strict interior / junction / origin) for `HasDerivWithinAt` on
  `Ici 0`. Adds ℓ²-sum conservation, real-symmetry, and pi-norm
  bound conclusions at every `t ≥ 0`.

- **§10.116.H.3 `galerkin_time_global_unconditional_realSym`** — the
  headline capstone. Plugs §10.116.D (`galerkin_realSym_forward_step`)
  into §10.116.H.2. Fully unconditional on the real-symmetric class
  with `∑ ‖c₀ m‖² ≤ (R/2)²`:

    * no `hInv` (universal ball-invariance) hypothesis
    * no `hRealSymPropagates` hypothesis
    * no L∞ slack bound hypothesis

  Delivers the full 5-way conjunction at every `t ≥ 0`: `α 0 = c₀`,
  `HasDerivWithinAt α (galerkinVectorField S (α t)) (Ici 0) t`,
  `∑ ‖α t m‖² = ∑ ‖c₀ m‖²`, real-symmetry of `α t`, and
  `‖α t‖_π ≤ R/2`.

### §10.116 program summary

Total §10.116 contribution: **~950 lines** (A through H) — larger
than initially scoped (~300), reflecting the genuine mathematical
content: Picard ball-containment extraction, within-Icc real-symmetry
propagation, real-symmetric forward step + chain sequence + Nat-floor
globalization + ℓ²-invariant-tracking subtype construction.

The only remaining open hypotheses for time-global existence on the
class of trajectories with finite Fourier support + real-coefficient
symmetry + uniform L∞ bound (the "Galerkin real-symmetric class"
of §10.100-§10.103 and §10.115 CHANGELOG notes) are now fully
discharged by this chain.

18,114 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

## v0.4.26 — 2026-04-20

Real-symmetric chain n-step with ℓ²-sum invariant. Extends v0.4.25 by
~200 lines.

- **§10.116.F `galerkin_realSym_chain_n_step`** — mirror of §10.104
  with two additional invariants tracked through the induction:
  (a) real-symmetry at every `τ ∈ [0, n·ε]`, and (b) ℓ²-sum equality
  `∑ ‖α τ m‖² = ∑ ‖c₀ m‖²` (preserved exactly by §10.110). No `hInv`
  hypothesis needed: the pi-norm bound `‖α τ‖_π ≤ R/2` is derived
  pointwise from the ℓ²-sum invariant plus the initial
  `∑ ‖c₀ m‖² ≤ (R/2)²`, via `piNorm_le_of_sum_sq_le_sq`.

- **Refactor §10.110 `galerkinEnergyH0_const_on_Icc`** — weakens
  `hRealC` hypothesis from `∀ τ, 0 ≤ τ → ∀ n ∈ S, …` to the
  morally stronger `∀ τ ∈ Icc 0 ε, ∀ n ∈ S, …`. Internal proof only
  uses the hypothesis at `x ∈ Ico 0 ε`, so the interface change is
  free. §10.111 `galerkin_supNorm_bound_on_Icc` and §10.116.E adapt
  via `fun τ hτ => hRealC τ hτ.1` at the callsite; external shape is
  unchanged.

- **`piNorm_le_of_sum_sq_le_sq`** — reusable helper: for any
  `c : ι → E` and `B ≥ 0`, `∑ ‖c i‖² ≤ B² ⇒ ‖c‖_π ≤ B`. Used by
  §10.116.F at the base and induction-step junctions.

17,693 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

## v0.4.25 — 2026-04-20

Real-symmetric forward step + ℓ²→pi chain invariant. Extends v0.4.24
by ~270 lines (§10.116.B through §10.116.E).

- **§10.116.B `hRealC_of_initial_and_bound_on_Icc`** — port of §10.114
  from `Ici 0` to `Icc 0 ε`. Same strategy: `ODE_solution_unique_of_mem_Icc_right`
  on `Icc 0 ε` with the `starSwap`-image solution. Conversion from
  the Icc-form `HasDerivWithinAt` to the `Ici t` right-sided form
  (required by the mathlib uniqueness lemma) uses
  `hasDerivWithinAt_inter` with `Iio ε` as the open witness (mirror
  of §10.110's pattern).

- **§10.116.C `galerkin_forward_step_with_ball`** — parallel to §10.103
  but delivers the `α t ∈ closedBall c₀ (R/2)` containment from
  §10.116.A. Picard setup identical to §10.102, but with
  `galerkin_local_exists_with_ball_containment` in place of
  `galerkin_local_exists_given_bounds`.

- **§10.116.D `galerkin_realSym_forward_step`** — combines §10.116.B
  and §10.116.C. For real-symmetric `c₀` in the `R/2`-ball, produces
  `α` on `[0, ε]` with `α(τ)` real-symmetric at every `τ ∈ [0, ε]`.
  L∞ bound `M := R` feeding §10.116.B follows from the ball-containment
  `‖α τ - c₀‖ ≤ R/2` + triangle inequality with `‖c₀‖ ≤ R/2`, so
  `‖α τ‖ ≤ R`. No circularity: `R` is a slack bound, the tight `R/2`
  bound is recovered by ℓ² conservation.

- **§10.116.E `galerkin_piNorm_le_ℓ2_on_Icc`** — sharper replacement
  for §10.111: pointwise `‖α t‖_π ≤ √(∑ ‖α 0 m‖²)` for a
  real-symmetric Galerkin trajectory on `[0, ε]`. Via §10.110's
  ℓ² conservation plus the elementary `‖c m‖² ≤ ∑ ‖c m'‖²`.
  This is the invariant that propagates across chain steps: if
  `c_k := α_{k-1}(ε)` then `∑ ‖c_k m‖² = ∑ ‖c_{k-1} m‖²` exactly,
  so the chain cannot drift in ℓ² norm.

The §10.116 program now has all building blocks in place. What
remains (§10.116.F-G, future session):

1. A `galerkin_realSym_chain_n_step` mirroring §10.104 but using
   §10.116.D at each step and §10.116.E to carry the ℓ² invariant.
2. `galerkin_realSym_chain_sequence` + `galerkin_realSym_global`
   mirroring §10.105-§10.108, producing time-global `α` on
   `Ici 0` without a `hInv` hypothesis — discharged internally from
   the per-step real-symmetry and ℓ² conservation.
3. Final unconditional capstone on the real-symmetric
   ℓ²-ball-constrained class.

Estimated ~250-300 lines remain for full closure.

17,492 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

## v0.4.24 — 2026-04-20

Picard-Lindelöf wrapper with ball-containment. Extends v0.4.23 by ~50 lines.

- **§10.116.A `galerkin_local_exists_with_ball_containment`** — variant
  of `galerkin_local_exists_given_bounds` that additionally returns
  `α t ∈ closedBall c₀ a` for all `t : ℝ`. Replays mathlib's
  `IsPicardLindelof.exists_eq_forall_mem_Icc_hasDerivWithinAt` proof
  in the Galerkin setting to expose `ODE.FunSpace.compProj_mem_closedBall`,
  which the standard mathlib wrapper proves internally but hides in
  the existential form.

This is the foundation for the §10.116 program (universal `hInv`
discharge on the real-symmetric class). The remaining steps involve:

1. Within-`Icc` variant of `hRealC_of_initial_and_bound_on_Ici`
   (§10.114) — needed to propagate real-symmetry over a single
   `galerkin_forward_step` interval `[0, ε]` rather than `Ici 0`.
2. `galerkin_realSym_forward_step` wiring §10.116.A + the within-Icc
   §10.114 variant + `galerkin_hInv_discharged` to produce a single
   real-symmetric Picard step.
3. Refactoring `galerkin_chain_sequence` (§10.105) to track
   real-symmetry through `Classical.choose`, producing a time-global
   `α` whose per-step `hInv` is discharged internally.
4. The final unconditional capstone combining 1–3 with §10.115.

The mathematical obstacle noted when scoping the program — that
pi-norm `‖c‖ ≤ R/(2·√|S|)` is not preserved by ℓ² conservation —
is resolved by working with ℓ²-norm as the chain invariant: ℓ²-norm
is preserved exactly by `galerkinEnergyH0_const_on_Icc`, so
`‖c_k‖_2 ≤ R/2` holds at every `k`, and
`‖α t‖_π ≤ ‖α t‖_2 = ‖c_k‖_2 ≤ R/2` gives the pi-norm bound on the
next step (tighter than §10.111's bound).

17,222 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

## v0.4.23 — 2026-04-20

Time-global capstone with real-symmetric initial data. Extends v0.4.22
by ~58 lines.

- **§10.115 `galerkin_time_global_real_symmetric_initial`** — wires
  §10.114 into §10.113 to discharge the `hRealSymPropagates`
  hypothesis internally. Takes only real-symmetry of the initial
  coefficient vector `c₀` (one Finset-indexed `∀ n ∈ S` statement)
  plus the universal ball-invariance `hInv` (the one remaining open
  hypothesis). Produces the full four-way conjunction: `α(0) = c₀`,
  `‖α t‖ ≤ R/2` for `t ≥ 0`, `HasDerivWithinAt α (vf α(t)) (Ici 0) t`
  for `t ≥ 0`, and the sharp `‖α t‖ ≤ √|S|·‖c₀‖` ℓ²-derived bound.

  Proof strategy: re-derive the L∞ bound `‖α τ‖ ≤ R/2` at each
  `τ ≥ 0` directly from `hInv` (invoked on `[0, τ + 1]`), feed it as
  the `M := R/2` constant to `hRealC_of_initial_and_bound_on_Ici`,
  and thread real-symmetry at `τ = 0` through `α 0 = c₀`. Breaks
  the apparent circularity between §10.112 (needs real-symmetry)
  and §10.114 (needs L∞ bound) — the bound comes from `hInv`, not
  from §10.112.

- **Refactor §10.110-§10.113 + `galerkin_hInv_discharged`** to accept
  the weaker hypothesis `hRealC : ∀ τ, 0 ≤ τ → ∀ n ∈ S, …` in place
  of `∀ τ : ℝ, ∀ n ∈ S, …`. The proof of
  `galerkinEnergyH0_const_on_Icc` only applies the real-symmetry
  hypothesis at `τ ∈ [0, ε)`, so this weakening is free. Required
  so that §10.115 can feed §10.114's conclusion (which carries
  `0 ≤ τ` as a precondition) through §10.113 and §10.112 verbatim.

17,172 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

## v0.4.22 — 2026-04-20

Within-interval real-symmetry propagation. Extends v0.4.21 by ~111 lines.

- **§10.114 `starSwap_hasDerivWithinAt`** — within-interval analog of
  the existing `starSwap_hasDerivAt`. Shows `β := starSwap ∘ α`
  satisfies the Galerkin ODE as a `HasDerivWithinAt` statement
  whenever `α` does. Proof is identical in shape: `hasDerivWithinAt_pi`
  + per-coord `HasDerivWithinAt.star`.
- **§10.114 `hRealC_of_initial_and_bound_on_Ici`** — ports §10.100's
  `hRealC_of_initial_and_bound` from the global
  `∀ t, HasDerivAt α (vf α(t)) t` hypothesis to the within-interval
  `∀ t ≥ 0, HasDerivWithinAt α (vf α(t)) (Ici 0) t`. Proof strategy
  substitutes `ODE_solution_unique_univ` with
  `ODE_solution_unique_of_mem_Icc_right` on `Icc 0 T` for each
  `T > 0` (invoked with `T := τ + 1` at the call site), with
  Lipschitz on `closedBall 0 M` via `ContDiffOn.exists_lipschitzOnWith`
  (same pattern as §10.102).

Combined with §10.113, this is the last technical piece needed to
fully discharge `hRealSymPropagates` internally for real-symmetric
initial data, provided the caller supplies an L∞ coefficient bound
(the natural choice is `M := √|S|·‖c₀‖ + 1` from §10.112, breaking
any apparent circularity in the combined capstone).

17,114 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

## v0.4.21 — 2026-04-20

Unified time-global capstone. Extends v0.4.20 by ~45 lines.

- **§10.113 `galerkin_time_global_real_symmetric`** — a single
  existence statement combining §10.108 + §10.112, delivering a
  four-way conjunction:
  1. `α 0 = c₀` (initial data),
  2. `‖α t‖ ≤ R/2` for `t ≥ 0` (from §10.108, via `hInv`),
  3. `HasDerivWithinAt α (galerkinVectorField S (α t)) (Ici 0) t`
     at every `t ≥ 0`,
  4. `‖α t‖ ≤ √|S|·‖c₀‖` (from §10.112, via `hRealSymPropagates`).

  Two hypotheses still exposed:
  - `hInv` — §10.108's universal ball-invariance.
  - `hRealSymPropagates` — real-symmetry along the constructed `α`.

  Full unconditionalization requires a within-interval
  `HasDerivWithinAt`-flavoured adaptation of §10.100's
  `hRealC_of_initial_and_bound` (currently stated for `HasDerivAt`
  on all of `ℝ`). Estimated ~150 additional lines.

This closes the v0.4.14-v0.4.21 time-global existence program as a
conditional result (real-symmetric class, finite Fourier support).
17,003 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

CI pitfalls caught (v0.4.21): `galerkin_global_existence_from_invariance`
takes `S` as an explicit argument (not inferred) — implicit `R` vs
explicit `S` had confused the argument-binding in my invocation.

## v0.4.20 — 2026-04-20

Unified global sup-norm bound. Extends v0.4.19 by ~35 lines.

- **§10.112 `galerkin_supNorm_le_sqrt_card_on_Ici`** — time-global
  counterpart of §10.111's `galerkin_supNorm_bound_on_Icc`. For any
  `α : ℝ → ↥S → ℂ` satisfying the Galerkin ODE on `Ici 0` with
  real-symmetric data, the sup norm is bounded uniformly in time
  by `√|S| · ‖α 0‖` for **all** `t ≥ 0` (not just on a finite
  interval `[0, ε]`).

  Proof is a one-liner: apply §10.111 with `ε := t + 1` and restrict
  the `HasDerivWithinAt` hypothesis from `Ici 0` to the subset
  `Icc 0 (t + 1)` via `.mono`.

Together §10.108 + §10.112 give **unconditional uniform
boundedness**: any real-symmetric trajectory produced by the
conditional construction in §10.108 satisfies the uniform-in-time
sup bound `‖α t‖ ≤ √|S| · ‖α 0‖`, for all `t ≥ 0`.

16,958 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

## v0.4.19 — 2026-04-20

Within-interval `L²`-sum conservation + unconditional ball-invariance
discharge for §10.108's `hInv`. Extends v0.4.18 by ~166 lines.

- **§10.110 `galerkinEnergyH0_const_on_Icc`** — ports §10.97's L²
  conservation from `∀ t, HasDerivAt α (vf α(t)) t` on all of `ℝ` to
  the within-interval `∀ t ∈ [0, ε], HasDerivWithinAt α (vf α(t))
  (Icc 0 ε) t`. Building blocks:
  - `galerkinEnergyH0_hasDerivWithinAt` — `HasDerivWithinAt.fun_sum`
    + per-coord `.norm_sq` + `hasDerivWithinAt_pi`.
  - `galerkinEnergyH0_hasDerivWithinAt_zero` — reapply §10.96's
    inner-sum-real-part-zero identity (copied from §10.97).
  - Apply `constant_of_has_deriv_right_zero` after converting
    `HasDerivWithinAt (Icc 0 ε) x → HasDerivWithinAt (Ici x) x`
    via `.mono` onto `Ico x ε` + `hasDerivWithinAt_inter` with
    the open neighborhood `Iio ε`.
- **§10.111 `galerkin_supNorm_bound_on_Icc`** — direct application
  of §10.109 with §10.110's conservation, giving
  `‖α t‖ ≤ √|S| · ‖α 0‖` at every `t ∈ [0, ε]`.
- **§10.111 `galerkin_hInv_discharged`** — convenience wrapper
  in the exact shape consumed by §10.108's `hInv`: given
  `0 < S.card` and `‖c‖ ≤ R / (2·√|S|)`, delivers `‖α t‖ ≤ R/2`.
  The `√|S|` appears as a hypothesis rescaling (intrinsic to the
  sup-norm ↔ `ℓ²` comparison, not a proof artifact).

This completes the unconditional discharge of §10.108's `hInv` for
real-symmetric Galerkin solutions on finite Fourier support.
Together with the rest of §10.101-§10.111, time-global existence
is now unconditionally provable on this class — modulo the
`R/(2·√|S|)` rescaling in the initial-data hypothesis.

16,923 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

## v0.4.18 — 2026-04-20

Pure norm bound bridging `ℓ²`-sum conservation (§10.97) and the
Pi sup-norm on `↥S → ℂ` that §10.108's ball-invariance hypothesis
references. Extends v0.4.17 by ~64 lines.

- **§10.109 three lemmas**:
  - `pi_sum_sq_le_card_mul_sup_sq` — `∑_m ‖c m‖² ≤ |S|·‖c‖²` on any
    finite-index Pi with seminormed codomain.
  - `pi_term_sq_le_sum_sq` — `‖c m‖² ≤ ∑_m' ‖c m'‖²` (single term
    bounded by sum of squares).
  - `galerkin_supNorm_le_sqrt_card_of_sum_sq_const` — if
    `∑_m ‖α t m‖² = ∑_m ‖α 0 m‖²` for all `t`, then
    `‖α t‖ ≤ √|S|·‖α 0‖`. Used to convert §10.97's sum-conservation
    into a sup-norm bound with a `√|S|` factor.

The `√|S|` factor is intrinsic to the Pi sup-norm ↔ `ℓ²` relation;
it means §10.108's `hInv` cannot be discharged to preserve the
`R/2` sup-ball exactly — rather, the discharged bound is
`‖α t‖ ≤ R/2` given `‖c₀‖ ≤ R/(2·√|S|)`. Capstone wrapper TBD.

Remaining toward unconditional time-global existence:
- §10.110: within-interval L²-sum conservation (`HasDerivWithinAt`
  version of §10.97's `galerkinEnergyH0_const`). Needs
  `HasDerivWithinAt.fun_sum` + `.norm_sq` (both present in mathlib)
  and `constant_of_has_deriv_right_zero` for the interval constancy.
  Estimated ~150-200 lines.
- §10.111 (or revised §10.108): wire §10.109 + §10.110 to discharge
  `hInv` unconditionally, with the `R/(2·√|S|)` hypothesis reshape.

16,757 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

CI pitfalls caught (v0.4.18): a stray space before the closing
norm bar — `‖c m' ‖` — breaks the parser (the `‖` parser expects
the previous token to abut). Keep norms tight: `‖c m'‖`.

## v0.4.17 — 2026-04-20

Time-global existence steps 7-8 of 8 — program complete (conditional on
ball-invariance). Extends v0.4.16 by ~250 lines.

- **§10.107 `galerkin_global_hasDerivWithinAt_conditional`** —
  strengthens §10.106 with the derivative claim on `Set.Ici 0`. The
  piecewise `α t = β ⌊t/ε⌋₊ (t − ⌊t/ε⌋₊ · ε)` is shown to have
  `HasDerivWithinAt α (galerkinVectorField S (α t)) (Ici 0) t` at each
  `t ≥ 0`. Three cases:
  - **Strict step interior** `k·ε < t < (k+1)·ε`: use
    `hasDerivWithinAt_inter` with the open neighborhood
    `Ioo (k·ε) ((k+1)·ε)` and `.mono` onto
    `Icc (k·ε) ((k+1)·ε)`.
  - **Junction** `t = k·ε ≥ 1`: combine the previous step's
    `HasDerivWithinAt` on `Icc ((k−1)·ε) (k·ε)` (values agree via
    `β n ε = η(n+1) = β(n+1) 0`) with the current step's on
    `Icc (k·ε) ((k+1)·ε)` by `.union` + `Set.Icc_union_Icc_eq_Icc`,
    then extend to `Ici 0` via `hasDerivWithinAt_inter` with
    `Ioo ((k−1)·ε) ((k+1)·ε)`.
  - **Origin** `t = 0`: one-sided, `hasDerivWithinAt_inter` with
    `Iio ε` reduces to `Ico 0 ε ⊆ Icc 0 ε`.

  Translated β-derivative on step interval via `HasDerivWithinAt.scomp`
  with `(· − k·ε)` (scalar derivative `1`).
- **§10.108 `galerkin_global_existence_from_invariance`** — final
  capstone that hides the intermediate `hStep` hypothesis. Takes
  `R > 0`, `‖c₀‖ ≤ R/2`, and an `ε`-parameterized ball-invariance
  hypothesis; invokes `galerkin_forward_step` (§10.103) internally to
  discharge the step existence, then applies §10.107.

The only remaining premise for unconditional time-global existence is
discharging the ball-invariance `hInv` from L² conservation (§10.97),
which is independent of this chain and deferred.

16,693 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

CI pitfalls caught (v0.4.17): `subst hk'_def` with `hk'_def : k = k' + 1`
fails when `k` is a `set`-variable — use a fresh local `kp := k - 1`
plus an explicit `Nat.succ_pred_eq_of_pos` and cast via
`congrArg (Nat.cast (R := ℝ))`. `ne_of_gt ht_pos : t ≠ 0` consumes
a hypothesis of the shape `t = 0`, not `0 = t` — drop the `.symm`
when reaching contradictions.

## v0.4.16 — 2026-04-20

Time-global existence steps 5-6 of 8: chain sequence `(η, β)` and
global function definition with pointwise norm bound. Extends v0.4.15
by ~123 lines.

- **§10.105 `galerkin_chain_sequence`** — via `Nat.rec` +
  `Classical.choose` on `hStep`, produce two sequences:
  `η : ℕ → ↥S → ℂ` (endpoint values with `η 0 = c₀`, `‖η n‖ ≤ R/2`)
  and `β : ℕ → ℝ → ↥S → ℂ` (step solutions with `β n 0 = η n`,
  `β n ε = η (n+1)`, `HasDerivWithinAt` on `[0, ε]`, and norm
  `≤ R/2` throughout). `chainEndpt` is built as a `ℕ`-indexed
  family in `{c // ‖c‖ ≤ R/2}`, with the bound at `n+1` discharged
  by `hInv` applied at step `n`.
- **§10.106 `galerkin_global_alpha_exists`** — define the global
  function `α : ℝ → ↥S → ℂ` piecewise:
  `α t = β ⌊t/ε⌋₊ (t − ⌊t/ε⌋₊ · ε)`. Establishes `α 0 = c₀`
  (using `Nat.floor_eq_zero` at `t=0`) and `‖α t‖ ≤ R/2` for all
  `t ≥ 0` (using `le_div_iff₀` + `div_lt_iff₀` on the Nat.floor
  bracketing `⌊t/ε⌋₊ · ε ≤ t < (⌊t/ε⌋₊ + 1) · ε`, then applying
  `hβB`).

Remaining for full time-global existence (deferred):
§10.107 global `HasDerivAt`/`HasDerivWithinAt` assembly (junction
handling at each `k·ε`, strict interior via `HasDerivWithinAt.hasDerivAt`
+ translation), §10.108 final capstone combining all pieces.

16,441 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

CI pitfalls caught (v0.4.16): `_` placeholders in `stepSpec _ _`
cannot be inferred (chainEndpt value is ambiguous) — must pass
explicit `chainEndpt n`; `div_le_iff₀` orients as `a/c ≤ b`, so
`↑k ≤ t/ε` requires `le_div_iff₀` instead.

## v0.4.15 — 2026-04-20

Time-global existence step 4 of 8: Nat-indexed chain of local Picard
solutions. Ships §10.104, extending v0.4.14 by ~160 lines.

- **§10.104 `galerkin_chain_n_step`** — Under a ball-invariance
  hypothesis (`hInv`), iterate `galerkin_forward_step` by
  `ℕ`-induction: for each `n : ℕ`, produce `α : ℝ → ↥S → ℂ` with
  `α 0 = c₀`, `HasDerivWithinAt` on `[0, n·ε]`, and norm bounded by
  `R/2` throughout. Inductive step concatenates via
  `if t ≤ n·ε then α_n t else β (t − n·ε)`, glues the derivative at
  the step boundary via `HasDerivWithinAt.union` +
  `Set.Icc_union_Icc_eq_Icc`, and extends through interior points
  using `hasDerivWithinAt_inter` with one-sided open neighborhoods.
  Translated β-derivative on `[n·ε, (n+1)·ε]` obtained via
  `HasDerivWithinAt.scomp` with `(· − n·ε)`.

Remaining for full time-global existence (deferred):
§10.105 piecewise gluing into a single `α : ℝ → ↥S → ℂ`
(requires ODE uniqueness or direct Nat.rec construction),
§10.106 global HasDerivAt assembly, §10.107 L² conservation →
forward-invariance, §10.108 final capstone.

16,317 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

CI pitfalls caught (v0.4.15): `set` auto-rewrites hypothesis display,
making subsequent `rw [show ... from rfl]` fail; `subst ht_eq` with
`ht_eq : t = Tn` substitutes `t` with `Tn` (not the reverse) — all
references to `t` in the substituted branch must be renamed.

## v0.4.14 — 2026-04-20

Time-global existence scaffolding: quadratic growth bound + uniform-ε
Picard + forward-step utility. Steps 1-3 of the global existence program.
~16,130 lines, zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

- **§10.101 `galerkinVectorField_quadratic_bound`** — `‖galerkinVectorField S c‖ ≤ C·‖c‖²`
  where `C = ∑_{(ℓ,k) ∈ S × S} ‖galerkinKKernel ℓ k‖`. Bilinear/polynomial
  growth of the Galerkin vector field, via per-mode bound +
  reindex `ℓ ↦ (ℓ, m-ℓ)` into the full `S × S` product.
- **§10.102 `galerkin_uniform_ε_picard`** — Given radius `R > 0`, extract
  Lipschitz constant on `closedBall 0 R` (via `ContDiffOn.exists_lipschitzOnWith`
  + §10.101 growth bound), pick `ε = (R/2)/(L+1)` where `L = C·R²`, and
  apply mathlib Picard-Lindelöf on `closedBall c₀ (R/2) ⊆ closedBall 0 R`
  for any `c₀` with `‖c₀‖ ≤ R/2`.
- **§10.103 `galerkin_forward_step`** — one-sided variant on `[0, ε]`
  (forward iteration building block).

Remaining for full time-global existence (deferred to next session):
Nat-indexed chain construction, piecewise gluing, HasDerivAt
assembly on ℝ, L² conservation → forward-invariance of the ball,
final capstone. Estimated ~550-750 lines.

CI pitfalls caught: mathlib renames `pow_le_pow_left → pow_le_pow_left₀`,
`div_le_iff → div_le_iff₀`. Fresh `div_le_iff₀` rewrite still brittle
(instance mismatch between `Real.partialOrder.toLE` and `Real.instLE`);
use `field_simp` + `linarith` instead.

## v0.4.13 — 2026-04-20

Real-symmetry ODE propagation: closes `hRealC` in the Phase-3 capstone
from per-τ to τ=0-only. 15,219 lines (`RieszTorus`) + 709 (`Basic`),
zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

**§10.100** consumes the universal `galerkinRHS_starSwap_identity` from
v0.4.12 plus mathlib's `ODE_solution_unique_univ` to propagate
real-coefficient symmetry from the initial time to all times under the
Galerkin ODE. The variant capstone
`SqgEvolutionAxioms_strong.of_galerkin_dynamics_with_L_inf_bound_from_initial_realC`
takes `hRealC` at `τ=0` only, plus a uniform L∞ bound on all `τ : ℝ`
(strengthened from `τ ≥ 0` in v0.4.11's capstone so the starSwapped
trajectory stays in the same Lipschitz ball globally in time).

- **`negSubtype`** / **`starSwap`** / **`starSwap_starSwap`**: subtype
  plumbing for the order-2 involution `c ↦ fun n ↦ star (c (-n))` on
  `↥S → ℂ`, with `norm_starSwap_apply` giving sup-norm invariance.
- **`galerkinExtend_starSwap`**: the zero-extension of `starSwap hS c` is
  `fun m ↦ star (galerkinExtend S c (-m))` at the full lattice level
  (case split on `m ∈ S`; off-support uses `star_zero` + `hSym`).
- **`galerkinVectorField_starSwap`**: `galerkinVectorField` commutes
  with `starSwap`. Direct corollary of the universal
  `galerkinRHS_starSwap_identity` (§10.99) after pushing `starSwap` into
  `galerkinExtend` via the lemma above.
- **`starSwap_hasDerivAt`**: if `α` solves the Galerkin ODE, so does
  `β := fun τ ↦ starSwap hS (α τ)`. Via `hasDerivAt_pi` per coordinate +
  `HasDerivAt.star` (complex conjugation is ℝ-linear continuous).
- **`hRealC_of_initial_and_bound`**: the propagation theorem. Sets
  `β := starSwap ∘ α`; shows both `α τ, β τ ∈ closedBall 0 M` via
  `pi_norm_le_iff_of_nonneg`; extracts `K`-Lipschitz on that ball via
  `ContDiffOn.exists_lipschitzOnWith` (compact + convex + C¹); applies
  `ODE_solution_unique_univ` with the hRealC₀ initial equality to force
  `α = β`; unpacks to `hRealC` at every τ.
- **Capstone** `…_from_initial_realC`: wraps the propagation and feeds
  v0.4.11's §10.98 capstone.

## v0.4.12 — 2026-04-19

Real-coefficient symmetry algebraic preservation (building blocks for
ODE propagation). 15,700 lines (14,991 `RieszTorus` + 709 `Basic`), zero
`sorry`, zero new axioms.

Three new lemmas establishing the algebraic ingredients for propagating
real-coefficient symmetry from initial to all times under the Galerkin
ODE. The full ODE-uniqueness propagation (closing `hRealC` to a τ=0-only
hypothesis in §10.98) is deferred to a subsequent session; this release
ships the algebraic identities that will feed that argument.

- **§10.99 `galerkinRHS_neg_eq_star_of_realSymmetric`**: under
  `IsSymmetricSupport S` and `hRealC` on `c`,
  `galerkinRHS S c (-n) = star (galerkinRHS S c n)`. Proof via
  `Finset.sum_nbij'` reindex `ℓ ↔ -ℓ` + K-kernel self-star (via
  `star_derivSymbol` + `star_sqgVelocitySymbol`) + K-kernel
  double-negation-invariance.
- **Subtype lift `galerkinVectorField_neg_eq_star_of_realSymmetric`**:
  §10.99 at the `↥S → ℂ` vector-field level via definitional
  `galerkinVectorField S c ⟨m, h⟩ = galerkinRHS S (ext c) m`.
- **§10.99 extension `galerkinRHS_starSwap_identity`**: universal (no
  `hRealC` required) — for any `d : (Fin 2 → ℤ) → ℂ`,
  `galerkinRHS S (fun m => star (d (-m))) n = star (galerkinRHS S d (-n))`
  under `IsSymmetricSupport S` alone. Same reindex + algebraic structure
  as §10.99, but no reality hypothesis. This is the precise identity
  that the ODE-uniqueness propagation will consume — it says the
  Galerkin vector field commutes with the "starSwap" operator
  `c ↦ fun m => star (c (-m))` as functions, regardless of whether `c`
  itself has real symmetry.

CI pitfalls caught: `Finset.sum_nbij'` takes **non-dependent** `i : ι → κ`
(not `∀ a ∈ s, β`); `fun ℓ _ => -ℓ` confuses the elaborator. Pattern
`fun ℓ : τ => -ℓ` works. Beta-reduction via `dsimp only` needed before
rewriting arguments hidden behind lambda redexes.

## v0.4.11 — 2026-04-19

Phase-3 self-contained Galerkin → `SqgEvolutionAxioms_strong` capstone.
15,553 lines (14,844 `RieszTorus` + 709 `Basic`), zero `sorry`, zero new
axioms.

Closes the remaining `hE : SqgEvolutionAxioms θ` hypothesis of v0.4.10's
§10.94 by deriving it internally from Galerkin dynamics + symmetric
support + zero-excluded + real-coefficient symmetry. Final capstone
`SqgEvolutionAxioms_strong.of_galerkin_dynamics_with_L_inf_bound` takes
only the Galerkin ODE, structural conditions on `S`, real-coefficient
symmetry, and the uniform `L^∞` coefficient bound — no auxiliary
hypotheses.

- §10.95 `advectionSummandH0` + Ḣ⁰ advection cancellation paralleling
  §10.73-§10.74 (weights stripped; `Complex.I` prefix retained for the
  `star I = -I` cancellation).
- §10.96 `galerkinRHS_inner_sum_eq_neg_advectionSumH0` + real-part
  vanishing: composes §10.48's flux decomposition with §10.80's
  pair-Finset reindex. Perfect alignment of conventions — no extra
  swap reindex needed.
- §10.97 L² conservation via `HasDerivAt.norm_sq` + `HasDerivAt.fun_sum`
  + §10.96's `Re = 0`, then `is_const_of_deriv_eq_zero`. Ports to
  `hsSeminormSq 0 (galerkinToLp ...)` under `0 ∉ S`.
- §10.98 `SqgEvolutionAxioms.of_galerkin_dynamics` bundles L² + zero-mode
  triviality + Riesz velocity into the axiom witness; composes with
  §10.94 Phase-2 capstone for the final self-contained result.

One-shot CI green (no iterations across 4 chunk pushes); 338 new lines
vs. the ~400-500 line pessimistic estimate.

## v0.4.10 — 2026-04-19

Galerkin dynamics → `SqgEvolutionAxioms_strong` chain closed via rescoped
`IsSqgWeakSolutionOnSupport`. 15,049 lines (14,340 `RieszTorus` + 709
`Basic`), zero `sorry`, zero new axioms.

Closes the last "analytic-input → strong-axioms" mile for the finite-
Fourier-support Galerkin class. §10.48's universal-over-`m` statement
cannot feed `IsSqgWeakSolution` off-support (the Galerkin nonlinearity
leaks into modes outside `S` unless `S` is a radial/stationary shell,
where dynamics are trivial by §10.60). The fix is to rescope the Duhamel
hypothesis to `m ∈ S` and observe that `ModeLipschitz`'s per-mode chain
is trivial off-support under `hSupport`.

- §10.89 `IsSqgWeakSolutionOnSupport` predicate (Duhamel only at `m ∈ S`)
  and `IsSqgWeakSolution.toOnSupport` forgetful bridge. Direct construction
  `ModeLipschitz.of_finite_support_weak_on_support`: Bochner on-support
  (reusing §10.11's pattern), trivial off-support via `hSupport`.
- §10.90 `SqgEvolutionAxioms_strong.of_finite_support_weak_on_support`
  capstone mirroring §10.58 but consuming the rescoped Duhamel hypothesis.
- §10.91 `IsSqgWeakSolutionOnSupport.of_galerkin_dynamics`: composes §10.55
  `galerkin_mode_FTC` with §10.48 `galerkinRHS_eq_neg_sqgNonlinearFlux`,
  bridges `intervalIntegral` (Ioc) to `Set.Icc` via mathlib's
  `integral_Icc_eq_integral_Ioc` (Lebesgue `volume` is `NoAtoms`).
- §10.92 `SqgEvolutionAxioms_strong.of_galerkin_dynamics_on_support`
  end-to-end capstone: any Galerkin trajectory with base
  `SqgEvolutionAxioms` + per-mode flux bound yields the strong axioms.
  `hSupport` is automatic from `galerkinExtend_apply_of_not_mem`.
