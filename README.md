A Lean 4 + mathlib formalization of Fourier-space identities for the inviscid
Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) equation on the 2-torus, together with a
conditional regularity roadmap.

Two algebraic theorems are fully machine-verified. A third (global regularity)
is supplied as a conditional result: a named, closed set of analytic
hypotheses, each of which is either discharged unconditionally in this
repository or scoped to a precise open problem.

The mathematical content is developed in the accompanying paper:

- **[`paper/sqg-identity.pdf`](./paper/sqg-identity.pdf)** — *The
  shear-vorticity identity and spectral concentration in SQG front dynamics.*
  ([markdown source](./paper/sqg-identity.md))

The formalization comprises over 21,000 lines of Lean 4 source in the
`RieszTorus` module (over 21,500 lines project-wide), with **zero
`sorry` and no axioms beyond mathlib**.

## What is proven unconditionally

### Theorem 1 (Shear-Vorticity Identity)

For the SQG velocity field `u = ∇⊥(−Δ)^{−1/2} θ` on `𝕋²`, the Fourier
multiplier of `S_{nt} − ½ ω` is `|k|·sin²(φ_k)`:

```
F[S_nt − ½ω](k) = |k| · sin²(α − β) · θ̂(k)
```

where `k = |k|(cos α, sin α)` and the front normal is `n̂ = (cos β, sin β)`.
In particular, `S_nt − ½ω ≡ 0` for any one-dimensional front.

Lean statement: `sqg_shear_vorticity_identity` in
[`SqgIdentity/Basic.lean`](./SqgIdentity/Basic.lean).

### Theorem 2 (Selection-Rule Bound)

Pointwise mode-level bound with equality characterization, integrated form
via Parseval on `L²(𝕋ᵈ)` and restated as an `Ḣ¹`-seminorm inequality.
Lives in `SqgIdentity/Basic.lean` (mode-level) and
[`SqgIdentity/RieszTorus.lean`](./SqgIdentity/RieszTorus.lean) (integrated).

### Supporting infrastructure

`RieszTorus.lean` develops a self-contained Fourier-multiplier account of the
torus Riesz transforms, Leray–Helmholtz projector, fractional Sobolev scale,
Biot–Savart factorisation, tight mode-level strain/vorticity identities, the
α-fractional heat semigroup and its smoothing bounds, and a parallel suite
for the classical heat semigroup. All bounds are established without
general Calderón–Zygmund singular-integral theory: they follow from Parseval
plus explicit Fourier-symbol inequalities.

## What is proven conditionally (Theorem 3 roadmap)

`RieszTorus.lean` §10 formalizes a conditional form of the regularity
theorem: given a named set of analytic hypotheses, uniform `Ḣˢ` bounds
follow. The hypotheses are explicit Lean structures, so the argument's
axiomatic footprint is inspectable.

| Hypothesis | Scope | Status in this repository |
|---|---|---|
| `FracSobolevCalculus` | Mode-wise Ḣˢ monotonicity | Discharged unconditionally (`ofMathlib`) |
| `MaterialMaxPrinciple` | Uniform Ḣ¹ bound | Discharged on the finite-support, uniform-ℓ∞-coefficient class (§10.56); lifted to every strong-`L²` Galerkin limit with uniform `Ḣ¹` bound via §10.167 |
| `BKMCriterionS2` | Ḣˢ bootstrap for `s ∈ (1, 2]` | Discharged on the same class (§10.57) and derived from Galerkin dynamics via a Kato–Ponce + advection-cancellation + Gronwall chain (§10.87); lifted to every strong-`L²` Galerkin limit with uniform `Ḣˢ` bound via §10.168 |
| `SqgEvolutionAxioms` | Mean + L² conservation + Riesz-transform velocity | Real content, discharged for the zero solution and for every finite-support weak solution (§10.58) |

**Capstones.** On the finite-Fourier-support, real-coefficient, uniform-ℓ∞
class, regularity is unconditional:

- `sqg_regularity_of_finite_support_uniform` — uniform `Ḣˢ` bound on
  `[0, T]` for every `s ∈ [0, 2]` with zero axioms.
- `BKMCriterionS2.of_galerkin_dynamics_with_L_inf_bound` — BKM
  criterion produced directly from Galerkin dynamics and an
  L^∞ coefficient bound; the energy inequality is derived, not assumed.
- **`galerkin_time_global_unconditional_realSym` (§10.116).** Time-global
  existence of a Galerkin trajectory on every symmetric Fourier support
  `S`, from any real-symmetric initial coefficient vector `c₀` satisfying
  `∑_{m ∈ S} ‖c₀(m)‖² ≤ (R/2)²`. Delivers, at every `t ≥ 0`:
  `HasDerivWithinAt` of the ODE on `Ici 0`, ℓ²-sum conservation,
  propagation of real-symmetry, and the pi-norm bound `‖α t‖_∞ ≤ R/2`.
  No open hypotheses: the program discharges `hInv` (universal
  ball-invariance), `hRealSymPropagates`, and every auxiliary L^∞ slack
  bound internally, via a chain of local Picard-Lindelöf steps whose
  ball-containment guarantee is extracted from
  `ODE.FunSpace.compProj_mem_closedBall` and whose ℓ²-sum invariant
  is preserved exactly by §10.110.
- **`exists_sqgSolution_of_galerkin_realSym` (§10.117).** Packages the
  §10.116 time-global Galerkin trajectory as an honest `SqgSolution`
  on `L²(𝕋²)`. For every symmetric support `S ⊆ ℤ²` with `0 ∉ S`,
  every `R > 0`, and every real-symmetric `c₀ : ↥S → ℂ` with
  `∑ ‖c₀(m)‖² ≤ (R/2)²`, there exists an `SqgSolution` whose
  time-zero slice is `galerkinToLp S c₀`. The underlying trajectory
  is `t ↦ galerkinToLp S (α t)` with `α` the §10.116 capstone;
  `SqgEvolutionAxioms` is discharged directly from the ℓ²-sum
  invariant (§10.117.B) and `smoothInitialData` from
  `hsSeminormSq_summable_of_finite_support` at `s := 3`.
- **Sₙ ↗ truncation infrastructure (§10.118–§10.123).** The nested
  symmetric Fourier boxes `sqgBox n`, the Fourier-coefficient
  restriction `fourierRestrict n θ`, and the uniform estimates that
  any weak-`L²` compactness argument needs. Starts from arbitrary
  `L²(𝕋²)` initial data with real-symmetric Fourier coefficients,
  builds the Galerkin family on `sqgBox n` from §10.116 at every
  level with a radius uniform in `n` (via Parseval), and establishes:
  uniform L² bound
  `hsSeminormSq 0 (galerkinToLp (sqgBox n) (αₙ t)) ≤ ∫ ‖θ‖²`, and
  per-mode pointwise bound
  `‖galerkinExtend (sqgBox n) (αₙ t) m‖² ≤ ∫ ‖θ‖²`.
- **Conditional Galerkin-limit → `SqgSolution` chain (§10.125–§10.130).**
  Hypothesis-keyed closure of the passage-to-the-limit half.
  `IsGalerkinLimitData θ b` packages the invariants any classical
  extraction yields (zero-mode, initial-data match, ℓ²-summability,
  ℓ²-sum conservation, real-symmetry); `GalerkinLimitTrajectory θ b`
  packages the synthesized `L²` trajectory with a Fourier-coefficient
  match. `SqgEvolutionAxioms.of_galerkinLimit` derives
  `SqgEvolutionAxioms` and `exists_sqgSolution_of_galerkinLimit`
  completes the chain to `SqgSolution` given a `smoothInitialData`
  summability on the limit. Exercised unconditionally on the zero
  datum via `exists_sqgSolution_ofZero`.
- **Concrete finite-support closure (§10.131–§10.132).** Instantiates
  the packaged hypotheses directly from §10.116's time-global
  Galerkin trajectory, giving
  `exists_sqgSolution_via_galerkinLimit_of_finite_support` — a
  parallel construction of the §10.117 `SqgSolution` now routed
  through §10.125–§10.130. Demonstrates the conditional chain is
  instantiable on non-zero inputs.
- **`SqgEvolutionAxioms_strong` via Ici-0 Duhamel port (§10.133–§10.134).**
  Upgrades the §10.117 / §10.132 `SqgSolution` to the Duhamel-level
  strong axioms. Uses
  `intervalIntegral.integral_eq_sub_of_hasDeriv_right_of_le` to port
  the §10.91 → §10.92 → §10.94 chain to consume the
  `HasDerivWithinAt ... (Ici 0)` shape delivered by §10.116.
  Headline: `exists_sqgSolution_strong_of_galerkin_realSym`.
- **Time-test → Duhamel bridge (§10.135–§10.136).** Structural
  closure of the step-(B) gap from §10.16:
  `IsSqgWeakSolution.of_timeTest_of_bumpSeq` lifts
  `IsSqgWeakSolutionTimeTest` to `IsSqgWeakSolution` given a
  `HasBumpToIndicatorSequence` witness. Proof is a one-line
  `tendsto_nhds_unique` on the two pointwise-equal sequences of
  integrals.
  `SqgEvolutionAxioms_strong.of_timeTest_via_MMP` composes with
  §10.14's MMP-keyed promotion.
- **Route B conditional chain for the generic-`L²` limit (§10.137–§10.146).**
  Structural closure of item 1 (originally "generic-L² Galerkin →
  full-SQG extraction"). Packages a classical Aubin–Lions extraction
  + `H⁻²` time-derivative bound + `l2Conservation` of the limit into
  a single conditional existence theorem
  `exists_sqgSolution_via_RouteB` for the `SqgSolution`. Exercised
  unconditionally on the zero datum by
  `exists_sqgSolution_via_RouteB_zero` (§10.146) via
  `HasAubinLionsExtraction.ofZero`. Per-mode Fourier convergence
  under strong-`L²` (§10.141 `tendsto_mFourierCoeff_of_tendsto_L2Sq`)
  is the bridge from the `Lp` side to the Fourier-coefficient side
  used throughout.
- **`l2Conservation` internally discharged (§10.147, v0.4.38).**
  The `hL2` hypothesis fed to §10.144 is produced unconditionally
  from the other Route B data: strong-`L²` convergence of the
  Galerkin restrictions + §10.97 per-level energy conservation +
  §10.142 zero-mode preservation. The hypothesis-free capstone
  `exists_sqgSolution_via_RouteB_from_galerkin_energy` (§10.148)
  produces an `SqgSolution` from `HasAubinLionsExtraction` alone,
  without the `hL2` input.
- **Structural chain for `HasAubinLionsExtraction` existence (§10.149–§10.153).**
  Factors the remaining item 1 analytical gap into three
  precisely-typed Lean construction targets, replacing the
  earlier "mathlib-scale weak-compactness infrastructure" blocker
  with named theorem signatures. Predicates:
  `HasModeLipschitzFamily` (§10.149) → `HasPerModeLimit`
  (§10.150) → `HasFourierSynthesis` (§10.151) →
  `HasAubinLionsExtraction` (§10.139) via the one-line bridge
  `HasAubinLionsExtraction.ofPerModeLimit` (§10.151).
  `HasModeLipschitzFamily.ofSqgGalerkinBounds` (§10.152)
  discharges the sup-over-time mode bound concretely from §10.123
  and takes the per-mode Lipschitz constant `L m` as input; the
  per-mode `H⁻²`-energy primitive `galerkinRHS_mode_bound_of_HsNeg2Bound_ne_zero`
  (§10.153.A) and the mean-value-theorem Lipschitz bound
  `galerkinExtend_mode_lipschitz_of_ODE_bound` (§10.153.B) supply
  the analytic inputs needed to close `L m` in a future session.
  Capstone `exists_sqgSolution_via_RouteB_from_perModeLimit_synthesis`
  (§10.156) produces an `SqgSolution` from the per-mode limit +
  Fourier synthesis data directly.
- **Item 1 three-target structural closure (v0.4.39).** All three
  remaining Item 1 analytical targets from v0.4.38 now have in-tree
  Lean constructors, reducing their content to named, precisely-
  typed classical-analysis hypotheses.
    - **§10.153.C `sqgGalerkin_modeLipschitz_from_UniformH2`** —
      Target #3 monolithic closure.  Composes §10.153.A + §10.153.B
      across `m = 0` / `m ≠ 0` and `s ≤ t` / `t ≤ s` splits into an
      existential `(L, hL_nn, hL_holds)` triple consumable by §10.152.
      Closed after a 6-retry diagnostic iteration that broke a
      `DecidableEq (Fin 2 → ℤ)` synthesis loop via
      `attribute [local irreducible] GalerkinRHSHsNegSqBound` plus
      dropping the `Uniform` wrapper from the signature.
    - **§10.154 coefficient-injectivity bridge + `HasFourierSynthesis.ofPerModeLimit`**
      — Target #2 structural constructor.  `Lp_eq_of_mFourierCoeff_eq`
      (§10.154.A) establishes that two `Lp ℂ 2` elements with matching
      Fourier coefficients are equal (via `mFourierBasis.repr.injective`).
      `HasFourierSynthesis.ofPerModeLimit` (§10.154.B) assembles
      `HasFourierSynthesis per θ` from a synthesis witness + initial
      coefficient match + strong-`L²` convergence.
    - **§10.155 `HasPerModeLimit.ofModeLipschitzFamily`** — Target #1
      structural reduction.  Takes a classical Arzelà–Ascoli + Cantor
      diagonal extraction witness and produces `HasPerModeLimit α`
      from `HasModeLipschitzFamily α`, via the
      `modeCoeff_eq_galerkinExtend` bridge lemma (§10.155.A).
- **Concrete Fourier synthesis operator (v0.4.39, §10.157–§10.158).**
  Not just a structural reduction: an in-tree construction from
  ℓ²-summable coefficient sequences to `Lp ℂ 2` elements.
    - **§10.157 `fourierSynthesisLp`** — lifts `b ∈ ℓ²(ℤ²)` to the
      corresponding `L²(𝕋²)` element via mathlib's
      `mFourierBasis.repr.symm`.  `mFourierCoeff_fourierSynthesisLp`
      proves the Fourier coefficients of the synthesis recover `b`.
    - **§10.158.A/B `θLimOfLp` + `mFourierCoeff_θLimOfLp`** — concrete
      `θ_lim : ℝ → Lp ℂ 2` operator for `HasFourierSynthesis` via
      pointwise Fourier synthesis of an `lp`-valued per-mode limit.
- **MMP off the finite-Fourier-support class (post-v0.4.39, §10.167).**
  Extends §10.56 from the finite-support + uniform-ℓ∞ class to every
  strong-`L²` Galerkin limit with a uniform `Ḣ¹` bound, via lower-
  semicontinuity of `hsSeminormSq` under strong-`L²` convergence.
    - **§10.167.A `hsSeminormSq_le_of_L2_limit_uniform_bound`** — pure
      Fourier-side LSC lemma. Strong-`L²` convergence + per-`n` weighted
      summability + uniform `Ḣˢ` bound ⇒ weighted family on the limit
      is summable and the bound transfers. Proof via per-mode Fourier
      convergence (§10.141) + `tendsto_finset_sum` +
      `summable_of_sum_le` / `Real.tsum_le_of_sum_le` from mathlib.
    - **§10.167.B `MaterialMaxPrinciple.of_L2_limit_uniform_H1`** —
      MMP for `θ` realized as pointwise-in-`t` strong-`L²` limit of a
      sequence with uniform `Ḣ¹` bound.
    - **§10.167.C `MaterialMaxPrinciple.of_aubinLions_uniform_H1`** —
      specialization to `HasAubinLionsExtraction`, consuming the
      §10.139 extraction witness + a uniform `Ḣ¹` bound on the Galerkin
      states `galerkinToLp (sqgBox n) (α n t)`. Produces MMP for
      `ext.θ_lim` with no additional analytic axiom.
- **BKM off the finite-Fourier-support class (post-v0.4.39, §10.168).**
  Parallel to §10.167 for `BKMCriterionS2`.  Same LSC mechanism at
  every `s ∈ (1, 2]`, so the BKM structure's internal `Ḣ¹` hypothesis
  is vacuous.
    - **§10.168.A `BKMCriterionS2.of_L2_limit_uniform_Hs`** — BKM from
      an `L²`-limit sequence with per-`s` uniform `Ḣˢ` bound on the
      sequence.
    - **§10.168.B `BKMCriterionS2.of_aubinLions_uniform_Hs`** —
      specialization to `HasAubinLionsExtraction`.  Together with
      §10.167, both `MaterialMaxPrinciple` and `BKMCriterionS2` lift
      off the finite-support class from uniform `Ḣˢ` control on the
      Galerkin approximation alone.
- **Theorem 3 on the Aubin–Lions limit (post-v0.4.39, §10.169).**
  Capstone composition of §10.167.C + §10.168.B +
  `sqg_regularity_via_s2_bootstrap`.  Delivers the conditional
  Theorem 3 conclusion `∀ s ∈ [0, 2], ∃ M', ∀ t ≥ 0,
  hsSeminormSq s (ext.θ_lim t) ≤ M'` from exactly the uniform-in-
  `n`-and-`t` `Ḣˢ` bounds on the Galerkin approximation at `s = 1`
  and `s ∈ (1, 2]`.  No finite-support restriction on `θ_lim`; no
  axiom beyond mathlib.  This is the maximally-closed form of
  Theorem 3 reachable from the current infrastructure.
  **§10.170** exercises the composition unconditionally on the zero
  Aubin–Lions extraction (`HasAubinLionsExtraction.ofZero`), giving
  `sqg_regularity_of_aubinLions_ofZero`.
  **§10.171 `sqg_solution_and_regularity_via_RouteB_uniform_Hs`** —
  end-to-end capstone combining §10.148 (`SqgSolution` producer)
  with §10.169 (Theorem 3 on the limit).  From an Aubin–Lions
  extraction + per-level energy conservation + velocity witness +
  smooth initial data + uniform `Ḣˢ` bounds, produces both a genuine
  `SqgSolution` on `𝕋²` and the full Theorem 3 regularity conclusion
  on `s ∈ [0, 2]` for that solution.

## What is *not* proven

- The fractional Sobolev bootstrap for `s > 2` (requires Kato–Ponce-type
  estimates on `𝕋²` that are not yet in mathlib).  Both
  `MaterialMaxPrinciple.hOnePropagation` and
  `BKMCriterionS2.hsPropagationS2` now lift off the finite-support
  class (via §10.167 and §10.168) given uniform `Ḣˢ` bounds on the
  Galerkin approximation, supplied by the caller.
- The remaining Item 1 classical analytical inputs, each consumed by
  the v0.4.39 structural constructors as a precisely-typed, named
  hypothesis:
    1. The **classical Arzelà–Ascoli + Cantor diagonal extraction
       witness** (the `hExtract` input of
       `HasPerModeLimit.ofModeLipschitzFamily`, §10.155.B).
       Mathlib has `BoundedContinuousFunction.arzelaAscoli` +
       `Denumerable (Fin 2 → ℤ)`.
    2. The **strong-`L²` convergence** of the extracted Galerkin
       sequence to the constructed `θ_lim` (the `h_L2` input of
       `HasFourierSynthesis.ofPerModeLimit` / `.ofSummable`,
       §10.154.B / §10.159.C).  Parseval + Fatou + dominated
       convergence on `ℓ²(ℤ²)`.
    3. The **per-mode ODE / continuity / H⁻² bound discharges** for
       §10.153.C's `hDeriv` / `hCont` / `hH2` hypotheses from
       §10.116's Galerkin trajectory + §10.138's `H⁻²` bound, via
       coordinate projection of the ODE derivative.
- A concrete `HasBumpToIndicatorSequence` witness (§10.135)
  constructed from mathlib's `ContDiffBump` infrastructure, to close
  item 6 analytically rather than only structurally.

## Building

The project uses Lake and pins mathlib to v4.29.0.

```bash
# elan installs Lean 4 and Lake
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
# Fetch pre-built mathlib olean cache, then build
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

A cold build with cache takes roughly five to ten minutes; incremental
builds are fast. Continuous integration runs the same command on every push.
